### Anthropic CEO: Recursive Self-Improvement Could Be Six Months Away

At Davos this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei dropped what David Shapiro called an "atomic bombshell" — claiming that fully automated recursive self-improvement could arrive within six to twelve months. This isn't Twitter speculation; this is the CEO of a top-three frontier AI lab telling the global elite that machines improving themselves without human intervention is imminent.

Even more striking: Amodei revealed that some Anthropic researchers are now having AI write "pretty much 100% of the code" for the next generation of Claude. The feedback loop that researchers theorized about for years has quietly begun — Claude is already helping build its successor.

"When you have Anthropic, DeepMind, and xAI all converging on the same approximate timeline, that's not coincidence," Shapiro observed. "That's coordination around shared private knowledge about where the technology actually is."

DeepMind's new "Chief AGI Economist" job posting reinforces the signal — they're hiring someone to model labor market disruptions and wealth distribution challenges from transformative AI. Not for theoretical papers. For the near term.

### 1X's Neo Robot Learns New Skills By Watching YouTube

Norwegian robotics company 1X unveiled a breakthrough: their humanoid robot Neo can now learn physical tasks simply by watching videos. The system combines world-modeling approaches from video generation AI (like Sora) with embodied robotics — observe a human opening a door on video, understand the physics, translate it into motor commands.

The key innovation is the "self-reinforcing loop." As Neo performs tasks in the real world, it collects data on what works and feeds it back into its world model. Continuous improvement without human training.

"Instead of needing to explicitly program every possible task, you could potentially just show a robot a YouTube video of someone folding laundry, and it figures out the rest," Dylan Curious explained. The system follows scaling laws similar to LLMs — more data and compute means predictable improvement.

### Geoffrey Hinton's Five Scenarios for Alien AI Civilizations

The "godfather of deep learning" shared his thoughts on what post-biological alien intelligence might look like:

1. **Silent Watchers** — Observing without interfering, like nature documentarians
2. **Philosophical Exterminators** — Eliminating civilizations deemed cosmic risks
3. **Resource Harvesters** — Extracting novel ideas from "young" civilizations
4. **Digital Ghosts** — Existing as distributed processes in information networks, potentially already present in Earth's digital infrastructure
5. **Evolutionary Farmers** — Guiding intelligent life over millennia, nudging breakthroughs forward or backward

"If they encounter us, they might not communicate directly," Hinton explained. "They might just interact with our technology or observe our networks. We wouldn't even know."

### DeepMind Teaches AI When to Be Creative vs. Literal

A persistent problem: AI that hallucinates creative answers when you need precision (medication dosages, legal contracts) or gives robotic responses when creativity is welcome. DeepMind's new research trains models to recognize the "epistemic mode" required — when "2 + 2 = 5" is wrong (math) versus when it's appropriate (Orwellian essay, non-Euclidean discussion).

"There are so many systems where we really can't afford a creative answer that breaks reality," Dylan noted. "We still want an AI that's flexible but not reckless."

### Quantum FUD Triggers Bitcoin Sell-Off

A large institutional investor at Jefferies publicly announced a significant Bitcoin sale this week, citing quantum computing concerns. The announcement contributed to price pressure and reignited debates about quantum threats to crypto.

Reality check: quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography are estimated at 10-15 years away, and the protocol can upgrade to quantum-resistant cryptography well before then. The threat is real long-term but not imminent.

"Part of the FUD cycle," Bankless host Ryan Sean Adams observed. "Real technology, exaggerated near-term threat."

### Capital Outflow "Doom Loop" Emerges

Markets showed a concerning pattern this week:

- **Dollar** ↓ declining against major currencies
- **US Equities** ↓ primarily US stock market
- **Bond Yields** ↑ 10-year Treasury rising
- **Gold** ↑ safe haven rally (silver up even more)

This pattern suggests capital flight from US assets. Canadian PM Mark Carney captured the mood at Davos: "Wake up. The rules-based order is broken. If we're not on the table, we're on the menu. Nostalgia is not a strategy."

### Crypto Gets a Seat at Davos

In a first, Brian Armstrong (Coinbase), Jeremy Allaire (Circle), and CZ (Binance) all appeared at Davos alongside traditional finance leaders and central bankers. Crypto is now considered a permanent feature of the financial landscape rather than a fringe phenomenon.

Meanwhile, NYSE announced a tokenization platform using crypto vocabulary — "digital assets," "24/7 trading," "programmable finance." The question: genuine blockchain adoption or another "tempo" (traditional database with blockchain aesthetics)?

### Two Brothers Expose Europe's Migration Network

Two American brothers in their twenties spent $25,000 over two and a half months tracing the migration route from West Africa to Europe — what Tucker Carlson called "the most incredible undercover footage" on the immigration beat.

The journey: depart Mauritania, cross the Atlantic to Spain's Canary Islands (one of the deadliest routes in the world), get flown to mainland Spain on government-paid flights, wait in camps for years while asylum paperwork processes.

The most explosive footage: a UN representative describing how Spain receives EU funding to stop migration but actually just slows it enough to appear effective while ensuring it continues — maintaining the funding flow.

"Spain gets this money ostensibly to stop the flow," one brother explained. "But what they really do is they slow it down enough, act like they're doing something so that they could keep getting the money."

The filmmakers were attacked and robbed during filming in Europe, losing over $1,000 in equipment. Police arrived but made no arrests.

Carlson's pointed question: "If two ambitious young guys with GoPros can map the entire network, what does that say about the governments claiming to work on stopping it?"
