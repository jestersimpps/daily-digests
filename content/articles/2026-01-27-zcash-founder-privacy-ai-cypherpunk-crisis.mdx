Zcash creator Zuko — now Chief Product Officer at Shielded Labs — delivered one of the most candid assessments of crypto's trajectory in a wide-ranging Bankless interview. His central thesis is uncomfortable: crypto is repeating Linux's mistakes, building revolutionary technology that only engineers use while the rest of the world stays locked into systems that exploit them.

## The Linux Warning

> "Crypto could be like Linux 15 years from now — something that a couple of mega corporations cost-optimize by using, while 99.9% of people are not empowered or benefited in any way." — Zuko

The parallel is precise. Linux set out to liberate computing from corporate control. It succeeded technologically — it runs most of the world's servers — but failed as a liberation movement. Regular people still use Windows, macOS, and iOS. The revolution became infrastructure. Zuko sees crypto heading down the same path: DeFi for institutions, surveillance chains for everyone else.

## UX is the Bottleneck, Not Technology

Drawing inspiration from Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike, Zuko argues the cypherpunk community has always had the wrong theory of change. The approach of "build tools for ourselves, then teach the world to be like us" has never worked and never will.

Moxie's key insight was that a truly honest UX would show every party with access to your data — the CEO, the sysadmins, the intelligence agencies. Signal "corrects the UX" by making encryption invisible and showing only the actual parties in the conversation. Crypto needs an equivalent breakthrough — privacy that just works without asking users to understand zero-knowledge proofs.

Both Moxie and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong have cited 100 million users as the threshold for real-world impact. Crypto isn't close.

## Telegram: The Elephant in the Room

Zuko doesn't pull punches on one of crypto's most uncomfortable truths:

> "Telegram is a freaking honeypot. It just makes me despair that all the crypto people use Telegram and think it's secure. How dumb can crypto people be?" — Zuko

He's blunt: Pavel Durov's organization receives a copy of everything typed in group chats. The crypto community's default communication platform offers effectively zero privacy.

## AI is Repeating Web2's Worst Patterns

The conversation took a sharp turn into AI, where Zuko sees history repeating at an accelerated pace. He points to ChatGPT censoring privacy tool recommendations from creator Naomi Brockwell's content — without anyone asking it to — as a canary in the coal mine. OpenAI introducing ads confirms the playbook: advertising plus lock-in equals exploitation.

Google's Gemini integration into Gmail and Calendar is running the same cycle "turbo" — embedding AI so deeply into everyday tools that extraction becomes nearly impossible.

## A Reason for Hope

Two bright spots emerged. First, Moxie Marlinspike is back and building a private AI product — which Zuko sees as potentially transformative for the intersection of privacy and artificial intelligence.

Second, Zcash's own price action validates demand. ZEC surged from roughly $50 to $750 (settling around $350) with no advertising and no lock-in. Purely organic growth driven by people who genuinely want financial privacy.

## Bottom Line

Zuko's prescription is deceptively simple: people should pay for products, and there should be open competition. Silicon Valley's feedback loop — better products generating more money generating better products — works brilliantly for DeFi but has completely failed for privacy and social tools. Signal actually loses money with each new user. Until crypto solves this economic problem, the cypherpunk dream remains just that — a dream.
