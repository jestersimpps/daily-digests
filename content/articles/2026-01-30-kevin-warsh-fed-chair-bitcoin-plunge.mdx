  videoTitle: "Here's why Fed contender Kevin Warsh is seen as bearish for bitcoin"
---

It was a brutal 48 hours for Bitcoin. From a weekly high near $91,000 on Wednesday to a panicked low of $81,000 by Thursday night, the largest cryptocurrency shed over 10% as markets digested what could be the most consequential Federal Reserve appointment in years.

The trigger: reports that the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh — a former Fed Governor with a track record of hawkishness that has analysts genuinely worried.

## The Warsh Problem

Kevin Warsh served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, a period that included the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. His track record during that crisis is what has markets spooked.

In September 2008 — the same month Lehman Brothers collapsed and the global financial system nearly imploded — Warsh stated: "I'm still not ready to relinquish my concerns on the inflation front."

Seven months later, with the Fed's preferred inflation measure at just 0.8% and unemployment at 9%, he doubled down: "I continue to be more worried about upside risks to inflation than downside risks."

"Markets generally view a resurgence of Warsh's influence as bearish for Bitcoin," said Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research. "His emphasis on monetary discipline, higher real rates, and reduced liquidity frames crypto not as a hedge against debasement but as a speculative excess that fades when easy money is withdrawn."

## The $1 Billion ETF Exodus

The institutional reaction was swift and severe. U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin and ether ETFs hemorrhaged nearly $1 billion in a single session — the worst combined outflow day since August.

BlackRock's IBIT, the flagship Bitcoin ETF, shed $317.8 million alone. Fidelity's FBTC lost $168 million. Grayscale's GBTC saw $119.4 million exit. On the Ether side, BlackRock's ETHA lost $54.9 million and Fidelity's FETH saw $59.2 million in redemptions.

The synchronized selling across both Bitcoin and Ether products suggests institutions were reducing overall crypto exposure — not rotating between assets. That's a notable shift from earlier in January, when Ether inflows often offset Bitcoin weakness.

## The Dollar Connection

The mechanics of the crash tell a clear story. Bitcoin peaked for the week late Wednesday as the dollar index (DXY) hit a multi-year low of 95.34. A weaker dollar typically supports risk assets. But the moment the dollar began strengthening — first gradually, then sharply on the Warsh news — Bitcoin's decline accelerated.

By Thursday evening, the dollar was surging and Bitcoin was gapping lower, ultimately bottoming at $81,000.

## The Trump Paradox

Here's what makes the Warsh nomination so confounding: Trump has repeatedly attacked Jerome Powell for keeping rates too high, demanded cuts to 1% (from the current 3.5%-3.7%), and positioned himself as the most pro-growth, pro-risk-asset president in memory.

Warsh's hawkish record is the opposite of that playbook.

"Kevin Warsh has been a monetary policy hawk his entire career," Renaissance Macro Research wrote on X. "His dovishness today stems from convenience. The President risks getting duped."

Bloomberg's Chief U.S. Economist Ana Wong was more blunt: "I read the FOMC transcripts during the GFC. His quotes scared me."

## Binance Makes a Counter-Move

Against this backdrop of institutional retreat, one major player went the other direction. Binance announced it would convert its entire $1 billion Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) from stablecoins to Bitcoin over the next 30 days, with regular audits and a commitment to top up if the fund's value falls below $800 million.

It's a bold signal of confidence — or at least a calculated bet that the selloff is overdone.

## Bottom Line

Bitcoin has managed to bounce to $83,000, but the dollar continues strengthening, raising questions about sustainability. The Warsh nomination isn't confirmed yet, and even as Fed chair he can't dictate rates alone — the Board of Governors votes collectively. But until there's clarity, his hawkish shadow will loom over risk assets. As one analyst put it: this looks like a leverage shakeout amid macro pressure, not the start of a bear market — but only if key support levels hold.
