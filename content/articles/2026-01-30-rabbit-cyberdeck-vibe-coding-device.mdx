  videoTitle: "Rabbit announces cyberdeck device and r1 updates"
---

Remember when "vibe coding" was just a meme about prompting AI to write your code? Rabbit apparently didn't get the memo that it was supposed to be a joke — the AI hardware company just announced a device specifically designed for it.

## Project Cyberdeck

Dubbed "Project Cyberdeck," Rabbit's new portable device is built from the ground up for natural language programming — what the community has taken to calling vibe coding. Details are still sparse, but the concept is clear: a purpose-built form factor optimized for the workflow of describing what you want in plain English and having AI generate the code.

It's a bold bet that vibe coding isn't a fad but a fundamental shift in how software gets built. Whether the world needs dedicated hardware for it, or whether a laptop with a good AI subscription does the job, is the billion-dollar question Rabbit is trying to answer.

## The r1 Gets Agentic

Alongside the new hardware announcement, Rabbit pushed an over-the-air update to its existing r1 device that transforms it into what the company calls a "plug-and-play computer controller." The updated r1 can now perform agentic tasks on a user's behalf — essentially acting as an AI assistant that can navigate and operate your computer autonomously.

The update also integrates OpenClaw, the open-source agentic tool formerly known as Moltbot and Clawdbot. This gives the r1 access to a broader ecosystem of computer-control capabilities developed by the open-source community.

## The Bigger Picture

Rabbit's moves fit into a broader industry trend: the shift from AI as a chat interface to AI as an agent that actually does things. The r1 update turns passive AI assistance into active computer automation, while the Cyberdeck imagines a world where the primary way humans create software is through conversation rather than keystrokes.

Whether Rabbit can execute on this vision — after the mixed reception of the original r1 launch — remains to be seen. But the company is clearly betting that the future of human-computer interaction looks very different from today.

## Bottom Line

Dedicated AI hardware is still a risky proposition, but Rabbit is doubling down with two distinct products for two distinct use cases: creating software (Cyberdeck) and controlling computers (r1). If vibe coding and agentic AI continue their current trajectory, Rabbit could be ahead of the curve. If they plateau, well — at least they'll have cool-looking paperweights.
