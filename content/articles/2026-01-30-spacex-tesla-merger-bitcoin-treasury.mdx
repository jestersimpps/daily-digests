  videoTitle: "SpaceX-Tesla merger talks puts nearly 20,000 bitcoin in focus"
---

There's a subplot to the Elon Musk empire consolidation story that's flying under the radar: a potential SpaceX-Tesla merger would quietly create one of the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holdings.

According to Bloomberg, Musk is considering a merger involving SpaceX, Tesla, or his AI firm xAI. While the headlines focus on the industrial logic and valuation mechanics, there's a $1.7 billion Bitcoin elephant in the room.

## The Numbers

SpaceX currently holds approximately 8,285 BTC, worth roughly $680 million. Tesla's treasury contains 11,509 BTC, valued near $1 billion. Combined, the merged entity would control nearly 20,000 Bitcoin — making it the world's seventh-largest BTC holder, just behind CoinDesk-owner Bullish's 24,300 BTC.

That's not MicroStrategy territory (which holds over 200,000 BTC), but it's significant enough to matter for market dynamics and corporate governance.

## The Accounting Headache

Here's where it gets complicated. Tesla is a public company subject to fair-value accounting rules, meaning every swing in Bitcoin's price flows directly through quarterly earnings. When BTC dropped from $114,000 to the high $80,000s last quarter, Tesla booked a $239 million after-tax loss on its digital assets.

SpaceX, still private, has avoided that kind of quarter-to-quarter scrutiny. But with a potential IPO valuing the company near $1.5 trillion, crypto exposure becomes a due diligence issue for institutional investors — some of whom remain skeptical about digital assets on corporate balance sheets.

A merger would force a decision about how this combined $1.7 billion position is governed, accounted for, and potentially financed.

## Tesla's Checkered Bitcoin History

The optics aren't great. Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in early 2021, sold a portion shortly after, then unloaded roughly 75% of its holdings in 2022 near bear-market lows. The episode earned Tesla a reputation as a high-profile but inconsistent corporate holder.

Any renewed focus on Musk-linked Bitcoin treasuries is sensitive territory for a reason.

## Bottom Line

Neither company has signaled plans to buy or sell Bitcoin as part of the merger discussions, and the holdings represent a small fraction of daily trading volumes. But the mere existence of these talks highlights something that's easy to overlook: Bitcoin has quietly embedded itself inside some of the world's most valuable technology companies. Even when it's not the headline, it's on the balance sheet — and institutional investors are always watching.
