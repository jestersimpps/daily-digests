One of the most striking speeches at Davos this week came from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who delivered a stark warning about the collapse of the post-World War II international order.

"Wake up. The rules-based order is broken," Carney declared. "There's a rupture in the world order. The end of a pleasant fiction, the beginning of a harsh reality—a reality where great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage."

## Nostalgia Is Not a Strategy

Carney's most memorable line cut through diplomatic niceties: "If we're not on the table, we're on the menu. So stop invoking rules-based international order as though it still functions as advertised. Call it what it is. Nostalgia is not a strategy."

The speech represents a remarkable acknowledgment from a leader of a traditional US ally. Carney is essentially telling middle powers—countries that benefited from American-led globalization but lack the economic or military might to set global rules—that they can no longer rely on the systems that governed international relations for 80 years.

## The Greenland Context

The speech came against the backdrop of President Trump's aggressive push to acquire Greenland, including statements at Davos that "anything less than US control of Greenland is unacceptable." Denmark responded by deploying military assets to the island in coordination with EU members.

## Capital Flight Patterns

For markets, the geopolitical uncertainty contributed to what analysts call a "capital outflow doom loop"—the dollar declining alongside US equities while bond yields and gold rose simultaneously.

"You saw it on the week: the dollar goes down, equities go down, yields on bonds go up, and gold goes up," Bankless host Ryan Sean Adams observed. This pattern suggests capital flight from US assets broadly.

## Bottom Line

Carney's speech may be remembered as the moment a major US ally publicly acknowledged that the American-led world order is being dismantled. What replaces it remains the defining question for markets and geopolitics alike.
