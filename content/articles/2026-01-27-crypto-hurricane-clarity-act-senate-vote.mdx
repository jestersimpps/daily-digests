The crypto market is heading into one of its most consequential weeks in years. The US Senate is scheduled to vote on the Clarity Act — a bipartisan market structure bill — on Thursday, while prediction markets are pricing in an 81% chance of a government shutdown by Friday. Meanwhile, on-chain data tells a story of aggressive accumulation that directly contradicts the prevailing sentiment of capitulation.

## The Clarity Act: Finally, Some Rules

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has expressed strong optimism about bipartisan progress on the bill, which addresses the longstanding jurisdictional turf war between the CFTC and SEC. Two parallel bills in the Agriculture and Banking committees aim to finally provide the regulatory clarity the industry has been demanding for years.

> "The need for this market structure regulation could not be more important." — Senator Kirsten Gillibrand

The vote was originally scheduled earlier in the week but was pushed to Thursday due to a DC snowstorm — a delay that adds to the tension given Friday's looming shutdown deadline.

## On-Chain Data Screams Accumulation

While sentiment feels like capitulation, the numbers tell a different story entirely. Ethereum saw $382 million in net inflows in just 24 hours. The staking queue has hit an all-time high. Transactions are at record levels. Centralized exchange reserves have dropped to all-time lows. Transaction fees are at record lows — meaning the network is busier than ever while remaining cheap to use.

On the Bitcoin side, whale wallets are in full accumulation mode. On-chain data shows overwhelming buying activity from large holders, even as retail sentiment craters.

## The October Hangover

Cathie Wood of ARK Invest attributes much of the current malaise to the October 10th Binance flash crash, which triggered $28 billion in liquidations and set off a prolonged unwind across the market.

> "Bitcoin's going to be hit the hardest because it's the most liquid crypto asset. We think that unwind is pretty much behind us." — Cathie Wood

She sees Bitcoin basing in the $80K–$90K range before resuming its upward trajectory. The bull market support band has flipped into resistance around $90K–$100K — a level Bitcoin needs to reclaim to confirm the next leg up.

## Gold Overshadowing Crypto's Quiet Strength

Tom Lee points out that the current gold and silver surge is pulling attention away from strengthening crypto fundamentals. He highlights Davos 2026 as a turning point: institutional players were openly building on Ethereum, signaling a level of mainstream acceptance that wasn't present even a year ago.

## Bottom Line

The sentiment reads as peak capitulation — and that's exactly where fortunes tend to be made. A pivotal Senate vote on Thursday could provide the regulatory clarity the market has been starving for, while on-chain fundamentals across both Bitcoin and Ethereum look the strongest they've been in months. The Altcoin Daily host isn't just talking the talk — he's buying Ethereum at what he considers generational accumulation prices.
