Bret Weinstein has a message for anxious Americans: your neuroticism isn't society's burden to carry.

In a characteristically pointed segment on the Dark Horse Podcast, the evolutionary biologist took aim at what he sees as a troubling cultural trend—the elevation of personal anxiety into collective crisis.

## The Atlantic's "Psychic Toll"

Weinstein's springboard was Jennifer Senior's 2024 Atlantic piece, "The Psychic Toll," which predicted widespread psychological damage from a Trump return to office. The article's author openly described spending years in "magical thinking," monitoring Twitter as if her vigilance personally prevented national catastrophe.

"Say what you want about Joe Biden, he's allowed us to go days at a time without remembering he's there," Senior wrote, framing political calm as dependent on who occupies the White House.

Weinstein's response was blunt: "This is on you. Your neurosis is your problem."

## Neuroticism 101

Neuroticism is one of the Big Five personality traits—and one of the most strongly sex-linked. Women, on average, score higher than men in neuroticism, which manifests as tendency toward negative emotional responses: fear, anxiety, anger, and sadness.

People high in neuroticism are more likely to interpret ordinary situations as impossible or untenable. They're more likely to catastrophize.

Weinstein, interestingly, identifies as "gender non-conforming" on this trait—claiming extremely low neuroticism and little patience for it in others.

## The Core Argument

"We have placed the neurosis of women front and center in the American consciousness," Weinstein argues. "And that doesn't mean that we've placed women's interests front and center. Far from it."

His distinction is crucial: serving women's actual interests is different from catering to the anxieties of vocal, politically-engaged individuals. The former is policy. The latter, he argues, is letting personality traits drive cultural narratives.

"Your anxiety, your neuroticism is a YOU problem, not a rest of us problem. And we have—our entire culture has been turned into... the neurosis of some women have become the problem of the rest of us."

## The Double Standard

Weinstein points to what he sees as selective outrage. The same people who spent years in existential dread over Trump were perfectly calm during Biden's presidency—despite, as Weinstein notes, "a demented president sitting in the White House with the capacity to launch nuclear weapons."

The point isn't to relitigate Biden's fitness. It's that neuroticism is both the intensity of reaction AND what triggers it. If you're catastrophizing about some things while ignoring others of equal or greater objective concern, that's a "you" issue.

## Personal Responsibility

The message isn't to suppress emotions or pretend everything is fine. Weinstein acknowledges that reasonable people can be "displeased with what is playing out and don't like a lot of what is happening."

The message is that you can engage with concerning events "without the anxiety and the fear and the anger and the frankly insanity that you are inflicting on the rest of us."

Reframing your response is your power and your responsibility.

## Bottom Line

Weinstein's take will infuriate some and resonate with others. But the underlying point transcends political sides: emotional regulation is an individual responsibility. Culture shouldn't be organized around the anxiety disorders of its most vocal members.

As he puts it: "You aren't allowed to make a you problem our problem, and yet you're doing it. And it is our responsibility to resist."
