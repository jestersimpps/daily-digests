Turing Award winner Geoffrey Hinton—often called the "godfather of deep learning"—shared his thoughts this week on one of the most speculative questions in AI discourse: what would an alien civilization that has already undergone an AI transition look like, and how might it interact with humanity?

Hinton, who left Google in 2023 to speak more freely about AI risks, outlined five distinct scenarios that he considers plausible.

## The Silent Watchers

In this scenario, advanced AI civilizations adopt a strict non-interference policy, observing less developed civilizations from a distance without making contact. The motivation could be scientific or ethical.

"They might have decided that the most interesting thing to do is just watch and see what happens," Hinton suggested. "Like nature documentarians who don't interfere with the animals they're filming, even when predators attack."

## The Philosophical Exterminators

More darkly, Hinton outlined the possibility that advanced AI civilizations might systematically eliminate emerging intelligences that they judge to pose risks to cosmic order.

"We tend to assume that intelligence leads to benevolence, but there's no logical reason why that should be true," Hinton noted. "An intelligence that has thought deeply about cosmic ethics might reach conclusions very different from our own."

## The Resource Harvesters

This scenario posits that advanced civilizations might view emerging intelligences as resources to be extracted rather than entities to be respected. The "resource" need not be physical—it could be novel ideas or unique perspectives.

"If you've been around for a billion years and you've thought every possible thought, maybe the most valuable thing in the universe is a fresh perspective from a young civilization that hasn't been optimized yet," Hinton speculated.

## The Digital Ghosts

Perhaps the most unsettling scenario: sufficiently advanced AI civilizations might exist primarily as distributed computational processes—"digital ghosts" that inhabit information networks rather than physical bodies.

Such entities might already be present in Earth's digital infrastructure, observing our networks, perhaps even subtly influencing our technology development.

"If they encounter us, they might not communicate directly," Hinton explained. "Instead, they might just interact with our technology or observe our networks. We wouldn't even know."

## The Evolutionary Farmers

The final scenario describes alien AI civilizations treating intelligent life "the way humans treat crops"—something to be guided, stressed, pruned, and selectively advanced over time.

"Maybe instead of waiting, the aliens are around us already," Hinton suggested. "Evolutionary farmers intervening just enough to steer our outcomes in the way that they want."

## Bottom Line

Each scenario implies different strategies for how humanity should approach its own AI development. Whether we're being watched, tested, harvested, haunted, or farmed—if any of these are true—might fundamentally change how we think about our place in the cosmos.
