The quantum computing threat to Bitcoin just got real—at least in the minds of some major Wall Street players.

Christopher Wood, one of the most widely-followed strategists on Wall Street, has made waves by dropping his Bitcoin allocation from his influential "Greed and Fear" model portfolio. His reasoning? Quantum computing could eventually break the cryptographic foundations that secure the Bitcoin network.

## From 10% to Zero

Wood, who works at investment banking firm Jefferies, had previously maintained a 5-10% Bitcoin allocation in his portfolio model. Now, he's replacing that position entirely with gold—the ultimate "anti-quantum" asset that can't be hacked regardless of computational advances.

"The uncertainty around quantum is just too high," Wood explained in his newsletter, which institutional investors closely follow for macro insights.

## Coinbase Agrees (Sort Of)

Interestingly, even crypto-native voices are acknowledging the risk. David Duong, Coinbase's head of research, agrees that approximately 33% of Bitcoin's supply could theoretically be vulnerable to quantum attacks. This includes coins sitting in older wallet formats that expose public keys directly.

The Bankless hosts didn't mince words: "Quantum could divide Bitcoin by zero... it could end Bitcoin."

## Not Everyone's Worried

To be fair, this isn't exactly an imminent threat. Current quantum computers are nowhere near capable of breaking Bitcoin's cryptography. Most experts estimate we're still years—possibly decades—away from "Q-Day" when quantum computers could pose a real danger.

Bitcoin developers have also been discussing quantum-resistant upgrades for years. The protocol can theoretically hard fork to adopt post-quantum cryptographic algorithms before any real threat materializes.

## The Real Story

What's notable here isn't whether quantum computing will actually kill Bitcoin—it probably won't, given the development community's awareness and timeline for upgrades. 

The real story is that institutional investors are now pricing in this tail risk. When major allocators start publicly citing quantum as a reason to reduce Bitcoin exposure, it signals a new phase in how traditional finance evaluates crypto assets.

El Salvador is reportedly already exploring quantum-resistant measures for their national Bitcoin holdings. If a nation-state is taking it seriously, perhaps the rest of us should at least be aware.

## Bottom Line

Quantum computing remains a theoretical threat to Bitcoin, but the narrative is shifting. As more institutional voices echo these concerns, expect this to become a recurring headwind for Bitcoin's "digital gold" thesis—even if the actual technology is years away from posing any real danger.

The question isn't whether Bitcoin can survive quantum computing. It's whether Bitcoin can implement upgrades before market sentiment prices in too much fear.
