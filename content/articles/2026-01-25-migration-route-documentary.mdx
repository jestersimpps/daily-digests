---

In an era when major news organizations deploy teams of dozens and budgets in the millions to cover international stories, a pair of American brothers in their twenties spent roughly $25,000 over two and a half months to produce what Tucker Carlson called "the most incredible undercover footage" on the illegal immigration beat—a ground-level documentary tracing the African migration route from departure points in West Africa to final destinations across Europe.

## The Route

The documentary follows the journey that hundreds of thousands of migrants have taken in recent years:

1. **Departure from Mauritania** — Migrants converge from across West Africa
2. **Atlantic crossing to Spain's Canary Islands** — One of the deadliest migration routes in the world
3. **Government-paid flights to mainland Spain** — Transported via commercial airlines
4. **Years in camps waiting for asylum paperwork** — "Only eat and sleep"
5. **Onward movement to France and the UK** — The flow continues even after the initial crossing

"It's kind of crazy that you as an American and your brother, just two ambitious young guys, can know exactly how this works," Carlson observed. "You don't work for CIA, right? And somehow you know the migrant route and the means of delivery."

## The Money Trail

Perhaps the most explosive footage captures a conversation with a United Nations representative who described what the filmmakers characterize as a systematic arrangement: Spain receives EU funding ostensibly to stop migration but actually just slows it enough to appear effective while ensuring it continues.

"Spain gets this money ostensibly to stop the flow," one brother explained. "But what they really do is they slow it down enough—it's not really a trickle, there's still thousands coming—but they slow it down a little bit, act like they're doing something so that they could keep getting the money, skim the money off the top, and then use the rest ostensibly to stop the flow. But of course, they never stop it."

The allegation—that migration management has become a self-perpetuating industry more interested in maintaining funding flows than actually reducing human flows—echoes criticisms leveled at humanitarian organizations in other contexts.

## Violence and Silence

The dangers of the journey are not limited to the ocean crossing. During filming in Europe, the documentary crew was attacked and robbed.

"He came in started throwing hands. He got bashed over the head," one of the brothers recounted. "I got up and sort of broke away and then the police came in and they took off. Nobody got arrested or anything like that."

The attackers escaped with over $1,000 worth of equipment. The incident illustrates both the risks journalists face covering migration and the broader security concerns some European communities have raised about large-scale immigration.

## The Missing Question

Perhaps the most striking observation concerns what the filmmakers did not find: any evidence of a coherent plan for integrating migrants into European society.

"Is there any assessment at all on the part of European governments as to what will these people do to improve our country?" Carlson asked.

"Not that I saw. They show up, okay? They're there in these camps for months. Then they're flown to the mainland... and they don't do anything all day. They don't work."

## Why Did It Take Two Kids?

Throughout the interview, Carlson returns to a pointed question: why did it take two young independents with minimal resources to produce this documentary rather than major news organizations with vastly greater capabilities?

The question implies that major outlets have chosen not to cover the migration story this way—whether due to ideological commitments, fear of controversy, or institutional inertia.

What is less debatable is that the documentary exists because two people decided to go see for themselves rather than relying on official sources and prepared statements. In an era of declining institutional trust, that model of journalism may be increasingly how significant stories get told.
