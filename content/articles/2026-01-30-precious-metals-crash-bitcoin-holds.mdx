The precious metals market just experienced something that hasn't been seen since the Hunt Brothers tried to corner the silver market in 1980. Silver, which touched a breathtaking $120 per ounce earlier in the Friday session, collapsed to $75 in a matter of hours — a 35% decline that wiped out nearly its entire January gain in a single afternoon.

Gold wasn't far behind. Having never seen $5,000 per ounce as recently as Sunday, the yellow metal surged to $5,600 on Thursday before retreating to $4,718, shedding 12% in a day. Platinum dropped 24%. Palladium fell 20%. The entire precious metals complex was in freefall.

## Meanwhile, Bitcoin Just... Sat There

While metals traders were experiencing the kind of volatility typically reserved for crypto markets, Bitcoin was doing something unusual: staying relatively calm. Trading around $83,000, BTC held above its Thursday evening panic low of $81,000, barely flinching as the commodities world burned.

For crypto bulls who spent months watching risk capital flow into red-hot metals instead of digital assets, this was the moment they'd been waiting for.

"Cryptocurrency markets have been the victim of risk capital flowing into the still popular commodities trade," said Paul Howard, director at trading firm Wincent. He pointed to growing interest in Bitcoin options markets, with the 105,000 BTC calls among the most actively traded contracts for February.

"The outlook indicates what a lot of crypto traders are feeling right now — that their market is long overdue a commodity-style catch-up," Howard added.

## The 2019 Pattern That Has Bulls Excited

There's a historical precedent that's getting attention. The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio — measuring how much gold one BTC can buy — has dropped 23% in January alone, bringing it to 16.3. Bitcoin has now underperformed gold for six straight months.

Here's where it gets interesting: this six-month pattern closely resembles what happened in 2019, when a similar gold-over-Bitcoin trend ran from August 2019 to January 2020. After that sequence ended, Bitcoin outperformed gold for the following five months.

The first signs of a potential reversal are already showing. The ratio bounced 4% on Friday after hitting a low of 15.5 on Thursday. From its late 2024 peak, the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio has declined roughly 60%, placing Bitcoin in a technical bear market against gold for about 14 months.

## What Triggered the Meltdown?

The catalyst appears to have been President Trump's selection of Kevin Warsh to replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair. Warsh's reputation as a monetary hawk sent shockwaves through risk assets, with the dollar strengthening sharply and triggering a cascade of selling across commodities and equities.

The Nasdaq dropped 1.25% and the S&P 500 fell 0.9%, but the real carnage was in metals — a market that had been on a parabolic tear for months and was arguably overdue for a correction.

## Bottom Line

The precious metals bubble may have popped, and crypto traders are watching closely. If the 2019 analogy holds, the rotation from metals to digital assets could be the catalyst Bitcoin needs to break out of its months-long underperformance. But even if the BTC-to-gold ratio has bottomed, that doesn't automatically mean moon — it may simply reflect gold weakening faster than Bitcoin. The next few weeks will tell if this is a genuine regime change or just a pause in the metals rally.
